This Repo is a great test of mental and physical strength which I have failed repeatedly except for that one time when I was 10 that I hosted my own website which was just a clean rip-off of the charts.

In what may be a golden age for easy deployment, can I deploy a website using a git repo and a Hetnzer server (or AWS if I can't get it going on Hetzner)
